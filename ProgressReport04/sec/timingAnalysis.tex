\section{Timing Analysis}

Previously, it was stated that the system was going to use two external crystal oscillators of 38.4kHz and 12MHz. The 12Mhz crystal was added to comply with the USB-to-SD reader specifications.  The 38.4kHz crystal was selected to comply with the frequencies needed for the rest of the communications. In a recent analysis, it was found that the 12Mhz crystal generates all the baud rates and frequencies needed with 0\% error. This is why this system will only be using an external crystal (of 12Mhz) instead of the two proposed before.   

%TODO add to this explanation all the calculations, etc....
