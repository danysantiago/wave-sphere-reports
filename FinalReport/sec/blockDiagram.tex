\section{Block Diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:blockDiagram} shows a revised system block diagram.  It contains the model numbers of the known components, the types of connections required to the microcontroller unit (MCU) and the amount of lines needed for each connection.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Microcontroller} -  Needed in order to be able to control and establish the communication between components as well as process the output of the sensors.

\item \textbf{Battery} - Required to provide the necessary power to the drifters because the electrical components are enclosed by a sphere.

\item \textbf{Power Management Circuit} - Composed of an LDO, a battery charger and a battery meter.  It is used to regulate the power provided by the battery, re-charge the battery once it has been depleted and to measure the amount of charge left on the battery.

\item \textbf{GPS Module} - Needed in order to know the precise location of the drifters when the user has to recover them after they have been thrown at sea for an experiment.

\item \textbf{Gyroscope} - Used to determine the rate of change of the orientation of the drifter while being carried by a wave.

\item \textbf{Accelerometer} - Used to measure the acceleration of the drifter while being carried by the waves.

\item \textbf{Magnetometer} - Used to determine the orientation of the drifter with respect to the Earth's magnetic north while it is being carried by a wave.

\item \textbf{Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)} - Needed in order to take the data from the accelerometer, which has an analog output, and convert it to digital signals so that the MCU can read them.  It is integrated within the MCU.

\item \textbf{SD Card and SD to USB Converter} - The SD Card is used to save the data captured by the sensors during an experiment.  The SD to USB converter will be used to allow the drifter to function as a mass storage device when connected to a Host computer via USB.

\item \textbf{XBee Module} - Used to connect the spheres with a central base so that data can be retrieved without having to open the spheres.


\item \textbf{RF Wakeup Module} - Used to wirelessly wake up the drifter from low power mode via an RF signal.
