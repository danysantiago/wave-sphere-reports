\section{Market Description}
The proposed system is designed to study the dynamics of surface waves, which is why the targeted market is any organization or individual that studies or researches the field of oceanography and wishes to perform Lagrangian or another similar analysis on the waves. 

The system is designed to be small and to be used throughout an entire day of experiments and not over an extended period of time. It is also intended to be used on surface waves and currents and not in deep sea currents.  These two characteristics make the proposed system greatly different from other oceanographic products such as drifters or buoys that are commercially available. A similar but somewhat limited implementation of the system exists and is currently being used by the research team that the authors of this work are trying to help.  This implementation costs around \$500 to \$800 for each sphere and it only measures the sphere's acceleration using a triaxial accelerometer, it also has to be turned on with a physical button and must be tied to a small cable with other capsules for it to not get lost. This work aims to add more functionality for the same price and if possible attempt to lower the cost.
