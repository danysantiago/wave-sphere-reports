\section{Project Timetable}

Figure~\ref{fig:simpleGantt} shows an overly simplified Gantt chart that only contains the milestones and deadlines for the semester.  The complete Gantt chart was too complex to include in the report.  A modified version suitable for printing has been included in Appendix~\ref{sec:detailedGantt}.  The complete Gantt chart is available online and can be found at the following web address: ~\url{http://tinyurl.com/Gantt-WaveSphere}
