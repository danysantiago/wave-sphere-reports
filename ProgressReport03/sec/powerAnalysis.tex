\section{Power Analysis}
The power analysis consists of four main parts: Logic Compatibility, Driving Capability, Power Supply, and OLDDC(?). The purpose of this analysis is to ensure that power requirements for each component is satisfied, thus guaranteeing functionality their functionality.

    Component & Vcc   & VIH   & VIL   & VOH   & VOL   & Notes \\
    \hline \hline
    MCU - MSP430FR5969 & 3.3   & 2.1   & 0.75  & 3.2   & 0.2   & Values are for the MSP430FR572x as they are not available for the selected microprocessor. \\ \hline
    Magnetometer & 3.3   & 2.64  & 0.66  & 3.3   & 0     & VDD*0.8 and VDD*0.2 Values assumed for VIH and VIL respectively, 0 and 3.3 for VOH and VOL because it uses CMOS technology \\ \hline
    XBee  & 3.3   & 2.838 & 0.594 & 2.838 & 0.594 & VOH and VOL assumed equal to VIH and VIL \\ \hline
    RF Wakeup & 3.3   & 1.914 & 0.99  & 2.9   & 0.4   & N/A \\ \hline
    Gyroscope & 3.3   & 2.64  & 0.66  & 2.64  & 0.66  & VOH and VOL assumed equal to VIH and VIL \\ \hline
    GPS   & 3.3   & 2     & 0.8   & 2.4   & 0.4   & N/A \\ \hline
    Battery Gauge Li-ion, Polymer & 2.5   & 1.2   & 0.6   & 2     & 0.4   & Logic Voltage Shifter was added to the schematic. \\ \hline
    SD Card & 3.3   & 2.64  & 0.66  & 2.64  & 0.66  & VDD*0.8 and VDD*0.2 values assumed for VIH and VIL respectively \\\hline
    Power Switch & 3.3   & 2.2   & 1.1   & 3.3   & 0     & VIH and VIL were extrapolated from Data sheet. 3.3 and 0 were assumed for VOH and VOL because it uses CMOS technology \\ \hline
    USB to SD Card Reader & 3.3   & 2.2   & 0.4   & 2.9   & 0.4   & N/A \\ \hline
