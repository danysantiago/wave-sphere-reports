Table \ref{tab:componentPinCount} shows a list of the essential components in the system along with their model number, supply voltage level, interface to the microcontroller and pin count.  This table is not meant to be exhaustive, it is simply a preliminary list to facilitate counting the pins required on the microcontroller. The components were chosen to satisfy the requirements specified in Table \ref{tab:sensorResolution}.

Since the SPI standard allows for the connection of multiple components with the same three clock, data-in and data-out lines, all the devices that have an SPI interface will be connected in parallel.  This allows for the use of less microcontroller pins while creating a simple and elegant design.  An individual pin has been assigned for the chip select lines needed for each component.  Although less pins could be used for the chip-select lines, the aforementioned approach was used in order to save space on the board by forgoing the need of using another integrated chip for a demultiplexer.  After taking this into account, the pin count is as follows:
