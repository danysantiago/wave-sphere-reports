\section{Revised Block Diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:blockDiagram} shows a revised system block diagram.  It contains the model numbers of the known components, the type of connection required to the microcontroller unit and the amount of lines needed for each connection.  Several components such as the power management circuit, battery meter and charger are still to be chosen as several methods of battery charging are being considered.
