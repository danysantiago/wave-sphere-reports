\noindent Wave post-breaking dynamics is a phenomenon that is not yet well understood. This work presents the design process and a discussion of the operation of a device to measure variables that are essential to the physics of wave breaking. The aforementioned device is a spherical drifter with a diameter of 7.5cm designed to closely imitate the dynamics of a particle in the water.  It is equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, allowing the drifter to measure its motion to nine degrees of freedom.  This will allow the researchers to reconstruct the device trajectory in the wave via dead reckoning.  A GPS module, on-board flash memory for data storage and a wireless communication module for data retrieval are also integrated.  An MSP430FR5969 from Texas Instruments controls and establishes communication between system components.  The designed user interface allows the researchers to interact with the drifters wirelessly as well as retrieve the data that has been captured after an experiment.  It is expected that, when used in synergy, multiple units will be able to greatly help researchers understand the dynamics of wave breaking.
