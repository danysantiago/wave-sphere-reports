\section{Memory Usage Details}

Figure~\ref{fig:memoryMap} shows a diagram of the memory used by the software.  It is divided into Program Memory (FRAM) and Data (RAM).  The values for this diagram were taken from the memory map created by Code Composer Studio.  Note that the memory blocks are not drawn to scale.
